## Persistent references

An object reference that is independent of any `HandleScope` is a _persistent_ reference. Where a `Local` handle only lives as long as the `HandleScope` in which it was allocated, a `Persistent` handle remains valid until it is explicitly disposed.

Due to the evolution of the V8 API, it is necessary for NAN to provide a wrapper implementation of the `Persistent` classes to supply compatibility across the V8 versions supported.
